# Adventure Sharer - RND Project

This is an application we have developed for a client for our final year project of University. The idea of the app is for users to be able to map out different walking/hikig tracks just
by going for a walk while the application tracks the journey for them. Along the way the user is able to mark out points of interest for other users to stop and look at. Users will also 
be able to view a list of thier own walks, as well as a list of all the other walks other user have uploaded along the way. This application is still heavily under development. 

_README.md still requires updates_
